# Classcharts for Android

This is a *native* android client for [classcharts](https://www.tes.com/en-gb/for-schools/class-charts) (the horrendous student management system my school switched to this year) written in kotlin with the jetpack compose framework for hack club's [midnight](http://midnight.hackclub.com)!

## Features

## Install

To download the apk, go to [releases](https://github.com/GingerGigiCat/ClassChartsAndroid/releases), expanded the assets section on the latest release, and download `app-release.apk` to your android phone.

Once the apk file has downloaded, tap it to open it, click through any complaints from your phone about sources allowed to install from, and it should install!

You can then open it from your normal home launcher!

## For reviewers or if you want a demo
